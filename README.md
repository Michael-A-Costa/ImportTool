# ImportTool

This is an example of a RabbitMQ worker I created that takes in a message and works through rows in a database to call an API to validate or process those rows.

Also included is extensive testing for that file, as well as a file containing the sqlachemy database queries and connections used in the RabbitMQ worker.

All code was written by me, with some documentation, type hinting, improvements, and test cases written or completed by AI
